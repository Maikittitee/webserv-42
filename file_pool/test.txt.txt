0. Uninstall previous SSQ's "SIMULIA FlexNet Server" if one is installed


1. Install or update the SolidSQUAD Universal License Server for vendor DSSimulia

   If SolidSQUAD Universal License Server has never been installed
   on the computer:

     - unzip the "SolidSQUAD_License_Servers" folder from 
     "SSQ_UniversalLicenseServer_Core_<release-date>.zip" to any DRIVE ROOT 
     folder X:\ (like C:\, D:\, E:\ etc), so the path will be:

	X:\SolidSQUAD_License_Servers

     - unzip the "Vendors" folder from 
      "SSQ_UniversalLicenseServer_Module_DSSimulia_<release-date>.zip"
      to the "SolidSQUAD_License_Servers" folder

     - for Windows as administrator run "install_or_update.bat" from 
       "SolidSQUAD_License_Servers" folder and wait until it completes

     - for Linux as root run "install_or_update.sh" from 
       "SolidSQUAD_License_Servers" folder and wait until it completes

   -- OR --

   If SolidSQUAD Universal License Server is already installed, 
   but the release-date of "SSQ_UniversalLicenseServer_Core_<release-date>.zip"
   is newer than the installed one, update the server installation:

     - for Windows as administrator run "uninstall.bat" from 
       "SolidSQUAD_License_Servers" folder and wait until it completes

     - for Linux as root run "uninstall.sh" from 
       "SolidSQUAD_License_Servers" folder and wait until it completes

     - unzip the "SolidSQUAD_License_Servers" folder from 
     "SSQ_UniversalLicenseServer_Core_<release-date>.zip" to any DRIVE ROOT 
     folder X:\ (like C:\, D:\, E:\ etc), so the path will be:

	X:\SolidSQUAD_License_Servers

     - unzip the "Vendors" folder from 
      "SSQ_UniversalLicenseServer_Module_DSSimulia_<release-date>.zip"
      to the "SolidSQUAD_License_Servers" folder

     - for Windows as administrator run "install_or_update.bat" from 
       "SolidSQUAD_License_Servers" folder and wait until it completes

     - for Linux as root run "install_or_update.sh" from 
       "SolidSQUAD_License_Servers" folder and wait until it completes

   -- OR --

   If the release-date of "SSQ_UniversalLicenseServer_Core_<release-date>.zip" 
   is not newer than the installed one but the release-date of 
   "SSQ_UniversalLicenseServer_Module_DSSimulia_<release-date>.zip" is newer than the 
   installed one, update DSSimulia module only:

     - unzip the "Vendors" folder from 
      "SSQ_UniversalLicenseServer_Module_DSSimulia_<release-date>.zip"
      to the "SolidSQUAD_License_Servers" folder

     - for Windows as administrator run "install_or_update.bat" from 
       "SolidSQUAD_License_Servers" folder and wait until it completes

     - for Linux as root run "install_or_update.sh" from 
       "SolidSQUAD_License_Servers" folder and wait until it completes

2. To bypass FlexNET License server check set the environment variable

     NOLICENSECHECK=true

3. Run DS.SIMULIA.SUITE.2022.WIN64.iso > 1 > setup.exe

   Select products to install
